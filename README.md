# Working Day

This is the README file for the Working Day project.

## Introduction

The Working Day project is a web application designed to assist users in managing their daily tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, organizing, and tracking tasks.

This project is a full-stack application created using Next. Data is persisted in a supabase DB.

### TODO:

- Use the useLocalTimerArray hook to improve response times of the timer array. Maybe use zustand and a store!
- Add alerts.
- Add overtime thresholds.
